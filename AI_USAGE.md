## AI Usage Declaration

In this project, I have built a dashboard that renders projects and display them. I have used ChatGPT at some places to find solution for my code. For example: 

-  Debugging layout and z-index issues
- Hamburger component understanding for mobile responsiveness
- Improving component structure suggestions
- To resolve some typescript conflicts
- Drafting small utility improvements and UI refinements

## What I Changed or Rejected

Not all AI suggestions were directly applied. I made the following decisions:

- Rejected suggestions that added unnecessary complexity for example extra data

- Removed redundant z-index layers that created stacking conflicts.

- Simplified layout structure instead of over engineering fixes.


I ensured that every applied change:

- Was fully understood

- Could be explained clearly

- Matched the architectural direction of the project
